:: beds {"position":"325,875","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the beds, a bittersweet memory begins to play out in your mind. You catch glimpses of the past, a time when the shrine priests lived joyfully within these walls. Laughter echoes through the air, and the sound of prayers being offered resonates with warmth and devotion.

Amidst the recollections, you spot a glimmer of something hidden beneath one of the tattered blankets. Carefully, you lift the moth-eaten fabric, revealing an item that holds significance in your quest. This newfound discovery serves as a reminder of the intricate interplay between past and present, urging you to carry the torch of your ancestors and restore the shrine to its former glory.

With the item securely in your possession, you take a moment to reflect on the resilience of your lineage and the weight of responsibility that rests upon your shoulders. The journey ahead is not an easy one, but with each step, you grow closer to fulfilling your duty and healing the shrine.

You decide to leave the beds behind for now and return to the living quarters, your mind filled with determination and purpose.

[[There is something on the bed.|photograph]]

:: continue {"position":"1500,1000","size":"100,100"}
There is a person, kneeling in front the statue that was once broken. 

There, those items that you collected were also present.

The man prays, and the memory fades away.

You leave the shrine. Although, not all your questions have not been answered. You leave with a sense of relief, a sense that you have done something good, and have calmed a raging spirit.

''The End''


:: courtyard {"position":"1500,550","size":"100,100"}
The deity's warning lingers in your mind, a constant reminder of the grave consequences that await failure. With a deep breath, you gather your resolve and survey the shrine before you. Three pathways stretch out, each holding its own mysteries and potential dangers.

To the left, you see the entrance to the [[living quarters]], once inhabited by your ancestors who faithfully cared for the shrine. Though the passage may hold clues to the missing items, it also carries the weight of their secrets and hidden perils.

Straight ahead lies the [[prayer room]], a place of reverence and spiritual connection. The air is thick with ancient energy, and the room beckons you to uncover its sacred knowledge. Here, the answers you seek may reveal themselves through prayers whispered in the hallowed space.

To the right, you find yourself drawn towards the [[storage room]]. In the dim light, water droplets echo, creating an eerie melody. The dampness hangs in the air, a stark contrast to the shrine's arid surroundings.

[[You go in the crater.->intro 3]]


:: intro 3 {"position":"1200,100","size":"100,100"}
With a mixture of curiosity and trepidation, you take a step forward, drawn to the ancient shrine like a moth to a flame. The path feels uneven beneath your feet, overgrown with weeds and obscured by fallen leaves. As you cautiously advance, an unforeseen misstep causes your foot to catch on a hidden root.

Unable to regain your balance, you stumble and lose control. Gravity pulls you downward, and with a startled gasp, you plummet into the dark pit. The air rushes past you as you fall, as you become discombobulated.

After what feels like an eternity, you finally come to a sudden stop, landing with a thud at the bottom of the pit. Your surroundings are pitch black, the only sounds echoing through the confined space are your own ragged breaths.

[[You get up.->intro 4]]


:: intro 3 old {"position":"800,400","size":"100,100"}
Now, as an adult, the burning desire to uncover the truth ignites within you. The whispers of the shrine's secrets have reached your ears through a family friend, who reveals its location. It's time to face your fears, confront the past, and find out what truly happened to your grandparents.

[[intro 3]]


:: intro 4 {"position":"1350,100","size":"100,100"}
Panic rises within you as you realize you are trapped. The pit's walls are steep and bumpy, leaving barely any footholds to climb out. It seems the shrine has claimed you as its captive. How did such a treacherous pit exist in the shrine's vicinity? Was it a deliberate trap, or a cruel twist of fate?

As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you catch a glimpse of what looks to be the shrine's courtyard, tauntingly close but agonizingly out of reach.

As you step into the kitchen, a vivid memory unfurls before your eyes. You find yourself immersed in a scene from the past, witnessing the diligent preparations of food offerings made by your ancestors. The rhythmic sounds of chopping and the fragrant aroma of incense fill the air, evoking a sense of devotion and reverence.

There is a [[scale]] of some sort.

There is a [[heavy item->rice bowl]] of some sort.

:: large pots of incense {"position":"1975,900","size":"100,100"}
The large pots of incense in the prayer room evoke a memory of preparing fragrant offerings to the deity. Each pot is adorned with intricate patterns and symbols, representing different aspects of worship and spirituality. The air is filled with a soothing aroma as the incense slowly burns, creating a serene atmosphere for prayer and reflection.

As you examine the pots more closely, you notice that one of them is missing. It seems like a crucial component is absent from the array of offerings. The |pot>[missing incense pot] raises questions and piques your curiosity. Could it hold a clue or possess a special significance?

You ponder the mystery of the missing incense pot, wondering what role it might play in your journey within this sacred space.

In this memory, youare shown a moment of quiet contemplation as you watched your grandparents light incense and offer prayers at the shrine. Your eyes wandered to the ornate calligraphy hanging on the wall, displaying a quote from a revered ancestor: "To find what's lost, seek the path of the forgotten."

You realize that this memory might hold a clue to the passcode. The phrase "path of the forgotten" stands out to you. You ponder its significance as you glance around the room, searching for any hints or connections to this phrase.

Your gaze falls upon a worn-out notebook resting on one of the shelves. Opening it, you discover a faded page with handwritten notes. And there it is, subtly embedded in the faded lines and symbols on the map, the numbers 024.-->

:: what happened {"position":"1500,400","size":"100,100"}
The voice speaks of the improper care the shrine has received, the broken statue of the deity, and the missing items that were once essential for its preservation. 

It becomes clear that in order to restore balance and heal the wounds inflicted upon the shrine, you must right the wrongs of your ancestors and find and reclaim these sacred items.

:: wishing well {"position":"2125,900","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the faint glow in the prayer room, your attention is drawn to a beautifully crafted wishing well located at the back. The gentle sound of trickling water adds to the peaceful ambiance. Peering into the well, you notice something [[glimmering at the bottom->wishing well riddle]]—a vital clue that holds the power to restore the statue.

:: wooden closets {"position":"600,875","size":"100,100"}
As you cautiously approach the wooden closets, the musty scent grows stronger. The doors creak open reluctantly, revealing the moth-bitten priest clothes neatly arranged inside. These ceremonial garments, once vibrant and significant, have fallen victim to time's relentless grasp.

You run your fingers over the delicate fabric, feeling the traces of history embedded within each thread. The official name for these clothes is "Kamishimo," a traditional attire worn by shrine priests during rituals and ceremonies. Though now tattered and faded, they still bear a sense of sacredness.

There is a [[box->examine box]] with something inside.

There is also [[some item->scented sachet]] lying on the ground.
