As you stand among the bloodstained armor, a flood of memories rushes through your mind, transporting you to a time of war and devastation. Images of injured soldiers seeking sanctuary and aid fill your thoughts, their faces etched with pain, determination, and the indomitable human spirit.

As you reflect on these memories, you are reminded of the immense sacrifices made by those who fought in wars.

:: beds {"position":"50,950","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the beds, a bittersweet memory begins to play out in your mind. You catch glimpses of the past, a time when the shrine priests lived joyfully within these walls. Laughter echoes through the air, and the sound of prayers being offered resonates with warmth and devotion.

Amidst the recollections, you spot a glimmer of something hidden beneath one of the tattered blankets. Carefully, you lift the moth-eaten fabric, revealing an item that holds significance in your quest. This newfound discovery serves as a reminder of the intricate interplay between past and present, urging you to carry the torch of your ancestors and restore the shrine to its former glory.

With the item securely in your possession, you take a moment to reflect on the resilience of your lineage and the weight of responsibility that rests upon your shoulders. The journey ahead is not an easy one, but with each step, you grow closer to fulfilling your duty and healing the shrine.

You decide to leave the beds behind for now and return to the living quarters, your mind filled with determination and purpose.

:: book {"position":"2475,750","size":"100,100"}
The book's cover shows signs of age, its once vibrant colors faded by time. The edges of the pages are frayed and yellowed, hinting at the countless hands that have turned them over the years.

As you flip through the pages of the worn book, your fingers tracing the faded words and illustrations, you reach the end. Curiosity compels you to glance at the final pages, and there, tucked away near the back, you notice something intriguing. Amongst the final paragraphs and notes, a small handwritten number catches your eye: a number 7.

It seems inconspicuous at first, a mere digit on the page, but a spark of recognition ignites within you. Could this number hold significance?

The deity's warning lingers in your mind, a constant reminder of the grave consequences that await failure. With a deep breath, you gather your resolve and survey the shrine before you. Three pathways stretch out, each holding its own mysteries and potential dangers. You must choose your path wisely.

To the left, you see the entrance to the [[living quarters]], once inhabited by your ancestors who faithfully cared for the shrine. Though the passage may hold clues to the missing items, it also carries the weight of their secrets and hidden perils.

Straight ahead lies the [[prayer room]], a place of reverence and spiritual connection. The air is thick with ancient energy, and the room beckons you to uncover its sacred knowledge. Here, the answers you seek may reveal themselves through prayers whispered in the hallowed space.

To the right, you find yourself drawn towards the [[storage room]]. In the dim light, water droplets echo, creating an eerie melody. The dampness hangs in the air, a stark contrast to the shrine's arid surroundings. <!--Here, the path may be treacherous, but it could lead to the discovery of essential items crucial to your quest.-->

You stand at the edge of a dense forest, your heart racing with anticipation. Before you lies an old and decrepit shrine, its weathered torii gates barely standing and the once vibrant colors faded. This shrine carries a dark history, steeped in the wrath of a vengeful spirit. Legend has it that the shrine was cursed after it was abandoned by its keepers.
[[intro 2]]

(display:"variables")


:: intro 2 {"position":"550,400","size":"100,100"}
As you gaze upon the dilapidated structure, your mind wanders back to your childhood and the unanswered questions that have haunted you for years. Your grandparents, who were the caretakers of this shrine, disappeared without a trace when you were just a child. Your parents, always tight-lipped about their fate, moved you far away, hoping to shield you from the shrine's malevolent legacy.
[[intro 3]]

Now, as an adult, the burning desire to uncover the truth ignites within you. The whispers of the shrine's secrets have reached your ears through a family friend, who reveals its location. It's time to face your fears, confront the past, and find out what truly happened to your grandparents.

[[intro 4]]


:: intro 4 {"position":"850,400","size":"100,100"}
With a mixture of curiosity and trepidation, you take a step forward, drawn to the ancient shrine like a moth to a flame. The path feels uneven beneath your feet, overgrown with weeds and obscured by fallen leaves. As you cautiously advance, an unforeseen misstep causes your foot to catch on a hidden root.

Unable to regain your balance, you stumble and lose control. Gravity pulls you downward, and with a startled gasp, you plummet into a hidden pit concealed beneath the earth. The air rushes past you as you fall, the darkness enveloping you completely.
[[intro 5]]


:: intro 5 {"position":"1000,400","size":"100,100"}
After what feels like an eternity, you finally come to a sudden stop, landing with a thud at the bottom of the pit. Your surroundings are pitch black, the only sounds echoing through the confined space are your own ragged breaths.

Panic rises within you as you realize you are trapped. The pit's walls are smooth and sheer, leaving no footholds to climb out. It seems the shrine has claimed you as its captive. How did such a treacherous pit exist in the shrine's vicinity? Was it a deliberate trap, or a cruel twist of fate?

As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you notice a faint glimmer in the corner of the pit. You crawl towards it, discovering a small crevice in the wall. Through this narrow opening, you catch a glimpse of the shrine's courtyard, tauntingly close but agonizingly out of reach.

[[you enter the shrine->start]]

As you step into the kitchen, a vivid memory unfurls before your eyes.

The rhythmic sounds of chopping and the fragrant aroma of incense fill the air, evoking a sense of devotion and reverence.

The large pots of incense in the prayer room evoke a memory of preparing fragrant offerings to the deity. Each pot is adorned with intricate patterns and symbols, representing different aspects of worship and spirituality. The air is filled with a soothing aroma as the incense slowly burns, creating a serene atmosphere for prayer and reflection.

As you examine the pots more closely, you notice that one of them is missing. It seems like a crucial component is absent from the array of offerings. The missing incense pot raises questions and piques your curiosity. Could it hold a clue or possess a special significance?

[[The memory fades|prayer room]] as you ponder the mystery of the missing incense pot, wondering what role it might play in your journey within this sacred space.


:: living quarters {"position":"325,825","size":"100,100"}
As you enter the living quarters, a somber atmosphere envelopes you. The room appears frozen in time, a snapshot of a bygone era. Dilapidated and worn, the remnants of what was once a place of comfort now lay in ruins.

:: memory {"position":"2050,1025","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the locked door, your attention is immediately drawn to the passcode lock, its metallic surface reflecting the dim light of the storage room. But as you examine it closely, a surge of nostalgia washes over you, transporting you back in time to a cherished memory from one of the previous keepers.

In this vivid recollection, you find yourself standing in the warm glow of your family shrine. The air is thick with reverence and the faint scent of incense, as generations of tradition come alive before your eyes. Your family, gathered together in solemnity, partakes in the rituals that have been passed down through the ages.

Among the objects placed upon the shrine, three catch your attention the first is a delicate(text-color:"yellow")[ rice bowl], a symbol of sustenance and abundance. Its smooth surface and intricate patterns reflect the craftsmanship of those who came before you, a testament to the value placed on nourishment and gratitude.

Next, your eyes settle on a (text-color:"yellow")[guard dog] figurine, its stoic expression and steadfast stance embodying protection and loyalty. Passed down through the generations, this figurine represents the watchful presence that has safeguarded your family, offering a sense of security and comfort in uncertain times.

But it is the (text-color:"yellow")[worn-out book] that holds a particular significance in your memory. Its pages, weathered and yellowed with age, contain the stories and wisdom of your ancestors.

In this memory, these three items, the rice bowl, the guard dog, and the worn-out book hold deep meaning and importance. They represent the rich tapestry of your family's heritage, the values and traditions that have shaped your identity. And now, standing before the locked door, you can't help but feel that these items must hold the key to unraveling the mysteries that lie beyond.

Suddenly, a voice resounds in your head, filled with accusation and anger. "You! It is your lineage that has caused this ruin!" The words reverberate within you, and you feel a weight of responsibility descend upon your shoulders.

The voice speaks of the improper care the shrine has received, the broken statue of the deity, and the missing items that were once essential for its preservation. It becomes clear that in order to restore balance and heal the wounds inflicted upon the shrine, you must right the wrongs of your ancestors and find and reclaim these sacred items.

:: weapons and armor {"position":"2475,625","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the collection of bloodstained weapons and armor in the storage room, you can't help but feel a mixture of awe and solemnity. These artifacts bear the weight of history, each one telling a story of its own.

The weapons, adorned with dried bloodstains, reflect the brutality of past conflicts. There are swords with blades of various lengths, their once-sharp edges now dulled from countless battles. Some blades bear nicks and notches, evidence of desperate clashes and close calls. The hilts of the swords, worn and weathered, still display remnants of intricate engravings and symbols, hinting at the cultural and artistic traditions from which they originated.

As your gaze shifts to the [[armor]], you see suits that once provided protection to brave soldiers on the battlefield. Each piece carries the marks of its encounters, with dents, scratches, and even punctures, testifying to the violence it endured. Chainmail shirts, interlocking rings tarnished with time, remind you of the intricate craftsmanship involved in their creation.

:: wishing well {"position":"1575,1100","size":"100,100"}
As you approach the faint glow in the prayer room, your attention is drawn to a beautifully crafted wishing well located at the back. The gentle sound of trickling water adds to the peaceful ambiance. Peering into the well, you notice something glimmering at the bottom—a vital clue that holds the power to restore the statue.

At this point, you have two options. You can either backtrack and explore the prayer room further, searching for the necessary tools to retrieve the item from the well's depths. Alternatively, you can attempt to solve a riddle or answer a question posed by the well, providing a different means of obtaining the item.

:: wooden closets {"position":"325,1000","size":"100,100"}
As you cautiously approach the wooden closets, the musty scent grows stronger. The doors creak open reluctantly, revealing the moth-bitten priest clothes neatly arranged inside. These ceremonial garments, once vibrant and significant, have fallen victim to time's relentless grasp.

You run your fingers over the delicate fabric, feeling the traces of history embedded within each thread. The official name for these clothes is "Kamishimo," a traditional attire worn by shrine priests during rituals and ceremonies. Though now tattered and faded, they still bear a sense of sacredness.

There is a [[box->examine box]] with something inside.

There is also [[some item->scented sachet]] lying on the ground.
